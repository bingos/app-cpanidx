=head1 NAME

App::CPANIDX - Queryable web-based CPAN Index

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Generate the index database

  $ cpanidx-gendb --config cpanidx.ini

  # Run the FastCGI script

  $ cpanidx-fcgi --config cpanidx.ini

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::CPANIDX provides a number of scripts to build a queryable web-based CPAN index.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration is dealt with by a L<Config::Tiny> based configuration file.

There are a number of parameters which can be specified

=over

=item C<dsn>

The L<DBI> dsn string of the database that the scripts will use. This is a mandatory requirement.

=item C<user>

The username for the supplied C<dsn>.

=item C<pass>

The password for the supplied C<dsn>.

=item C<url>

The C<cpanidx-gendb> script will poll this url when it has finished its update. It should be the
root url of your CPANIDX site

  url=http://my.cpanidx.site/cpanidx/

=item C<mirror>

The url of a CPAN mirror site where C<cpanidx-gendb> will obtain its index files from. If not
supplied it defaults to the Funet site L<ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/CPAN/>.

=item C<socket>

This is the socket that L<FCGI> should listen on for requests. It is a mandatory requirement for the
C<cpanidx-fcgi> script.

=item C<skipcore>

Applicable to the C<cpanidx-gendb> script, will skip the generation of the L<Module::CoreList>
based tables.

=item C<skipmirrors>

Applicable to the C<cpanidx-gendb> script, will skip the generation of the mirrorlist
based tables.

=item C<skipperms>

Applicable to the C<cpanidx-gendb> script, will skip the generation of the CPAN permissions
based tables.

=back

=head1 SCRIPTS

Both the scripts will by default look for a C<cpanidx.ini> file in the current working directory
unless you specify an alternative with the C<--config> command line option.

=over

=item C<cpanidx-gendb>

Generates the CPANIDX database. It will retrieve the CPAN index files from a CPAN mirror and
parse them to build the database.

The CPAN indexes are downloaded to C<~/.cpanidx> by default. You may override this location
by setting the C<PERL5_CPANIDX_DIR> environment variable to a different location to use.

In tests a L<DBD::SQLite> database took over 3 minutes to generate and a L<DBD::mysql> database
took 30 seconds.

It is recommended that one uses cron or some such scheduler to run this script every hour to
ensure freshness of the CPAN index.

=item C<cpanidx-fcgi>

Presents the CPAN index to web clients via FastCGI. Specify a socket that the script should
listen for requests on and configure your webserver accordingly.

The following is an example for Lighttpd:

  fastcgi.server = (
        "/cpanidx/" =>
         ( "localhost" => (
            "host" => "127.0.0.1",
            "port" => 1027,
            "check-local" => "disable",
            )
         ),
  )

The interface that clients can query is described below.

=back

=head1 INTERFACE

The C<cpanidx-fcgi> provides a number of ways that clients can access information from the CPAN Index.

The information is provided in a number of different formats: YAML, JSON, XML and HTML.

Information is requested by using a special URL

  http://name.of.website/<prefix>/<format>/<cmd>/<search_term>

We will assume that <prefix> is C<cpanidx> for the purposes of this documentation.

=over

=item C<<format>>

The format may be one of C<yaml>, C<json>, C<xml> or C<html>.

=item C<<cmd>>

The command may be one of the following:

=over

=item C<mod>

exists.
