NAME
    App::CPANIDX - Queryable web-based CPAN Index

SYNOPSIS
      # Generate the index database

      $ cpanidx-gendb --config cpanidx.ini

      # Run the FastCGI script

      $ cpanidx-fcgi --config cpanidx.ini

DESCRIPTION
    App::CPANIDX provides a number of scripts to build a queryable web-based
    CPAN index.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration is dealt with by a Config::Tiny based configuration file.

    There are a number of parameters which can be specified

    "dsn"
        The DBI dsn string of the database that the scripts will use. This
        is a mandatory requirement.

    "user"
        The username for the supplied "dsn".

    "pass"
        The password for the supplied "dsn".

    "url"
        The "cpanidx-gendb" script will poll this url when it has finished
        its update. It should be the root url of your CPANIDX site

          url=http://my.cpanidx.site/cpanidx/

    "mirror"
        The url of a CPAN mirror site where "cpanidx-gendb" will obtain its
        index files from. If not supplied it defaults to the Funet site
        <ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/CPAN/>.

    "socket"
        This is the socket that FCGI should listen on for requests. It is a
        mandatory requirement for the "cpanidx-fcgi" script.

SCRIPTS
    Both the scripts will by default look for a "cpanidx.ini" file in the
    current working directory unless you specify an alternative with the
    "--config" command line option.

    "cpanidx-gendb"
        Generates the CPANIDX database. It will retrieve the CPAN index
        files from a CPAN mirror and parse them to build the database.

        The CPAN indexes are downloaded to "~/.cpanidx" by default. You may
        override this location by setting the "PERL5_CPANIDX_DIR"
        environment variable to a different location to use.

        In tests a DBD::SQLite database took over 3 minutes to generate and
        a DBD::mysql database took 30 seconds.

        It is recommended that one uses cron or some such scheduler to run
        this script every hour to ensure freshness of the CPAN index.

    "cpanidx-fcgi"
        Presents the CPAN index to web clients via FastCGI. Specify a socket
        that the script should listen for requests on and configure your
        webserver accordingly.

        The following is an example for Lighttpd:

          fastcgi.server = (
                "/cpanidx/" =>
                 ( "localhost" => (
                    "host" => "127.0.0.1",
                    "port" => 1027,
                    "check-local" => "disable",
                    )
                 ),
          )

        The interface that clients can query is described below.

INTERFACE
    The "cpanidx-fcgi" provides a number of ways that clients can access
    information from the CPAN Index.

    The information is provided in a number of different formats: YAML,
    JSON, XML and HTML.

    Information is requested by using a special URL

      http://name.of.website/<prefix>/<format>/<cmd>/<search_term>

    We will assume that <prefix> is "cpanidx" for the purposes of this
    documentation.

    "<format">
        The format may be one of "yaml", "json", "xml" or "html".

    "<cmd">
        The command may be one of the following:

        "mod"
            Takes a search term which is a module name to search for.
            Returns information relating that module if it exists.

              curl -i http://name.of.website/cpanidx/yaml/mod/LWP

              HTTP/1.1 200 OK
              Content-type: application/x-yaml; charset=utf-8

        "auth"
            Takes a search term which is the CPAN ID of an author to search
            for. Returns information relating to that author if they exist.
